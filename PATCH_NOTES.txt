	  individual, in particular, who provided a large number of these)

	* Added digsite progress bar to nUI movers

	KNOWN ISSUES: 

	* The Skada info panel has been intentionally disabled until Skada and nUI can play
	  nice together. Skada is throwing errors that are breaking nUI.

	* Fixed XP to level 91-97 (thank you Roland)

	NOTE: XP to level 1-90 and 98-100 are still incorrect values for the 6.0 patch. Copy & 
	      paste the following command into chat for any of the missing levels and e-mail
		  the result to me at kscottpiel@gmail.com - I will include them in the next update

/script print((UnitXPMax("player") or "nil").." XP at level "..(UnitLevel("player")  or "nil"));

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 6.00.00 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added Latin American Spanish localization (thank you Daniel)

	* Fixed missing slash command localization entry for the Boomkin bar in all languages 
	  
	  I need translations done for these two phrases in Spanish, German, French, Korean,
	  Russian, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese if anyone cares to provide them:

		command = boomkin

		desc    = nUI does not use a dedicated Boomkin bar by default, using that bar for 
		          the action bar at the bottom right of the dashboard instead. The '/nui 
				  bar boomkin' will toggle the use of the bottom right action bar on and 
				  off as a dedicated bar for your boomkin.

		message = nUI: the dedicated Boomkin action bar has been %s // (enabled or disabled)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.42 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed nUI integration with Skada (thank you Xrystal)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.41 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed problem with Pilgrim's Bounty and other special action bars (thanks Xrystal)
	* fixed micro-menu positioning bug introduced in the 5.4.2 patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.40 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed startup error trying to set cVar

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.39 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Undid watch frame changes -- allows watch frame to be moved again, but reintroduces
	  some taint issues. It's a no-win. Hopefully there will be less issues with the taint
	  than there was with the location of the frame. /sigh

	* Fixed the micro buttons getting stepped on when entering/leaving pet battles

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.38 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added fix for "otherHealPrediction" nil error in FrameXML\UnitFrame.lua (thanks Seer)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.37 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed bug in main action bar when extra action button is displayed (thanks Xrystal)
	* Fixed location of pet name in party and raid unit frame panels (thanks Xrystal)
	* Hopefully fixed a combat taint error when mousing over unit auras (thanks Belechannas)

	* Added support for flyout spells (i.e. Shaman) to cooldowns (thanks Belechannas)

	Of particular note to Druids... the bottom right action bar is no longer used as a
	dedicated bar for your Boomkin form. Instead, by default, the Boomkin form will use 
	your main caster bar and the bottom right bar on the dashboard can be used for other
	things now. If you prefer to have a separate, dedicated, bar you can use for your
	Boomkin, you can use the command '/nui bar boomkin' to toggle this behavior on/off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.36 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Try again... fat fingered files in 5.07.35

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.33 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed XP required to level 85-90

	* Added support for cooldowns on passive spells that implement them

	* Added '/nui boomkinbar' to enable/disable the use of a special bar for boomkins. The
	  default behavior is for the boomkin form to have its own bar just as it does in the
	  Blizz interface. When this command is used, it will toggle the boomkin bar on/off so
	  that when it is disabled, the Boomkin form will use the same bar as the default Druid
	  caster bar (page 1). When the boomkin bar is disabled, the lower right bar in the nUI
	  interface will not conflict with the Boomkin form's main bar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.32 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * This release fixes an error in the action bars where the main action bar was hidden
       when the extra action button was displayed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.27 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixes action bars for vehicles and extra action button

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.26 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * When configuring which unitpanel layout to display include a test for group size to make sure it doesn't default to raid10 rather than party if you have 5 or less people.

    * Added the new status tests for extrabar and overridebar to the registerstatedriver statement. Ultraxion fights should now work great.  Finally.

    * Removed extrabar from the registerstatedriver statement as it has to exist alongside the main action bar.

    * Removed redundant file path for texture icons in button bag to remove green boxes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.25 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* YA compilation of all of Xrystal's fixes for the WoW 5.0.4 patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.24 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Yet another pass at trying to fix the PlayerPowerBarAlt and ExtraACtionBarFrame
	  sure would be easier if I could test them myself ~frown~ Me thinks I need to grind
	  a toon in all my copious free time (cough cough)
	  
	* Fixed the missing group loot windows #3 & #4
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  cooldown timer problem since the 4.3 patch
	  
	* Modified nUI_Movers (again) to try and fix PlayerPowerBarAlt and ExtraActionBarFrame
	  for the Atrameded and similar fights
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.22 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated TOC for 4.3 patch
	
	* Changed how movers are initialized to allow easy addition of new Blizz elements
	  (incorporating part of what Xrystal did in "nUI : Plugin [Custom Movers]" 
	  
	  NOTE: nUI will (should) automatically disable nUI_Plugin_CustomMovers if it is 
	        installed so the two apps don't confict. However, if you have it installed
	        it is recommended you remove it as it is no longer needed.
	  
	* Added PlayerPowerBarAlt, TutorialFrameAlertButton and ExtraActionBarFrame to the
	  new movers definitions
	  
	* Incorporated Xrystal's nUI_UnitPower fix for the divide by zero error when mousing
	  over other players
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.21 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added '/nui viewport' command to allow the viewport to be toggled on and off so the
	  viewport can be enabled most of the time (thus increasing viewable world space and
	  centering the player/HUD on the viewable area) and disabled when in the WoW zones
	  where viewports are broken (such as Throne of Tides) -- the viewport cannot be
	  toggled unless you are out of combat
	  
	* Moved the initialization of key bindings from the PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event to the
	  VARIABLES_LOADED event because it is now possible to enter the world before variables 
	  are loaded and ready for interpretation (sigh).
	  
	* Changed the anchoring the special class bars (Eclipse, Shard, Holy Power) so they do
	  not depend on the nUI HUD casting bar being present.
	  
	* Added error trap to catch bad return values from GetCurrentBindingSet() that caused
	  the key binding function to break in nUI
	  
	* Fixed a layering problem in the combat log that allowed the combat log text to hide
	  the combat log filtering buttons
	  
	* Fixed an error in the combat log that threw an error if you tried to click in the 
	  combat log text area (it was trying to open a chat edit box where there isn't one)
	  
	* Disabled the minimimze function on the combat log -- it doesn't need minimizing in
	  the info panel and was throwing errors because it was looking for a chat edit box
	  that doesn't exist in the combat log
	  
	* Fixed the errant display of the button bar to the left of the combat log that was
	  overlapping some of the buttons on the action bar right of the unit frames
	  
	* Moved new user tooltips alert button to right side of game field above the voice
	  chat control box so it doesn't overlap the minimap anymore
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.20 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated for 4.2 patch

	* Fixed sizing of the latency and frame rate meters for extra button in 4.2 patch

	  interfere with the mouse
	  
	* Modified automatic faction tracking to ignore guild reputation changes
	
	* Fixed location of map coordinates when world map is not maximized
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.19 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed the bag bar so tooltips don't appear and the mouse does not interact with the
	  bar when the '/nui bagbar off' option is used
	  
	* Fixed the upper console that so that other mods that modify the micro menu and other
	  elements cannot "show" the elements when the '/nui console off' option is used... 
	  this was causing elements to be mouse active, with tooltips, when they were hidden
	  
	* Fixed a scaling error in the Battlefield Minimap info panel
	
	* Fixed a logic error in the raid sort that was duplicating some units and not showing
	  other units
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.18 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed debug print messages appearing when a unit frame is right-clicked
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.17 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated TOC for WoW 4.1 patch
	
	* Removed happiness icon from pet unit frames (hunter's no longer need to manage it)
	
	* Fixed right-click menu on unit frames with raid sort
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.16 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed aura layout error in the party and raid panels that caused auras to overlap
	  the upper action bars (different problem than the one fixed in 5.07.15)
	  
	* Fixed layering problem in unit frame and HUD aura buttons that caused them to 
	  interfere with the mouse when targeting/clicking
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.15 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a sizing problem in the aura frames
	
	* With auras working in a more sane manner now, the maximum number of auras displayed
	  for the player and pet buffs has been increased to ensure visibility.
	
	* Fixed an error in the combat feedback system that was causing the unit frames to
	  flash red on incoming heals
	  
	* Fixed an issue that caused hidden default Blizzard UI elements to briefly appear 
	  while in combat
	  
	* Attempted to fix raid sorting (only works out of combat)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.14 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Another pass at resolving the issues with aura displays... modified player, target,
	  pet and vehicle auras to build from the bottom up to eliminate floating auras
	  
	* Fixed tooltips on target debuff (help) auras
	
	* Fixed aura overlap from unit frames over action bars
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  buffs, in the HUD
	  
	* Fixed HOT/DOT bar display overlapping cooldown bar in the HUD
	
	* Moved the location of the guild instance difficulty flag so it does not overlap the
	  tracking button on the minimap.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.07.12 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Modified aura logic to try to eliminate problems with auras not updating in combat

	* Fixed a chat frame layering problem that caused all buttons for all docked frames
	  to display when the mouse was over the frame versus only the buttons for the visible
	  chat frame
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.28
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a loader error that caused the management of the watch frame to fail if the
	  watch frame was not initialized before the PLAYER_LOGIN event
	  
	* Changed info panel load sequence to execute off PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD versus
	  PLAYER_LOGIN to ensure WoW UI elements and addons are properly initialized
	  
	* Modified info panel exception handler to preserve stack trace for debugging
	
	* Added the conversation button to the list of managed chat frame buttons
	
	* Modified size and location of edit frame chat box to ensure is does not overlap 
	  chat frame controls
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.27
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed chat frame integration so that when a new chat window is created, it is 
	  correctly anchored and sized including the layering and position of the edit box.
	  This should correct issues with both BNet and whisper frames as well as the auto-
	  join guild recruitment channel.
	  
	* Changed chat frame edit box layering to try and ensure the edit box is always 
	  layered highey than the chat frame itself (this cannot account for any changes a
	  chat addon may make)
	  
	* Changed info panel initialization to occur at PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event rather than
	  the PLAYER_LOGIN event to ensure integrated addons have had time to initialize 
	  properly. This change addresses a problem in starting Skada for some users.
	  
	* Added exception handling to the nUI_InfoPanel engine so that broken info panel plugins
	  will not cause the nUI load itself to break (a la the 3.3.5 patch nightmare)
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.26
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a bug in the nUI_InfoPanel_CombatLog that tried to hide the minimize button
	  when it may not actually exist and threw a RegisterStateDriver error
	  
	* Moved the button frame in the chat frames to make sure it does not overlap the
	  resize widget in the bottom right corner of the chat frame
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in nUI_InfoPanel_Skada that caused the infomation panel loader
	  to create a panel for Skada even when Skada was not installed or was disabled
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Hot fix... the Skada fix works if you have Skada installed, but breaks if Skada is
	  not installed... gee... guess I should have tested that the fixes didn't break 
	  anything when Skada wasn't present, huh? /sigh
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.24
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added a backdrop to the chat frame edit box to provide a clean overlay for the
	  background text and hid the default frame so it does not interfere with the background
	  text when not entering new chat text.
	  
	* Moved the chat frame edit box up to waste a bit less space at the top of the frame.
	
	* Removed nUI's manipulation of the chat frame font size so the font size is set by
	  the new chat settings menu
	  
	* Fixed loader logic error in the nUI_InfoPanel_Skada module so Skada integrates with
	  nUI again by default.
	  
	* Added setting of the buttonSide value in each chat frame to prevent BNet from throwing
	  errors when a realID friend logs off
	  
	* Fixed the layout of chat tabs if you have more than three chat frames anchored to 
	  the default chat frame.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.23
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed an error thrown when a member of your RealID friend list logs in
	
	* Fixed a "Frame is not movable" error thrown when you have extra chat frames enabled
	
	* Fixed anchoring of chat edit boxes in a chat frames
	
	* Removed chat edit box from combat log
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.22
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated for WoW patch 3.3.5
	
	* Fixed loader problem with the new chat frames
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.21
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_Buttons module that caused spell cooldowns to not
	  update while the spell was active on the current target if the spell duration option
	  ( /nui bar duration ) was disabled on the action bars. 
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a upper console anchoring issue that broke detection of FuBar and other LDB
	  addons with top bars
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.19
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed the location of the player and cursor coordinates in the world map when the
	  map changes between full screen and windowed modes
	  
	* Fixed a problem with the nUI_Movers logic in the micro-menu bar that prevented the
	  bar from being moved when the movers were active.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.18
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added a trap to the key binding logic to prevent an error being thrown if the current
	  binding set is undefined.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_MicroMenu module which could cause issues when trying
	  to overload the micro menu location via a plugin.
	  
	* Added the ability for health, power and status bars to collapse to, and expand from,
	  their horizontal and vertical centers. (with thanks to Belechannas)
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.17
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a anchoring error in the nUI_HUD module that caused the HUD selector button to
	  be anchored to both the top center of the viewport and the top center of the micro
	  menu which broke the '/nui movers' function for the micro menu.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_SpecialBars modules that made the mover for the pet,
	  shapeshift and stance bars too small to see
	  
	* Modified nUI_ChatFrame module to not attempt to set or alter the chat frame text size
	  if either Prat or Chatter is installed
	  
	* Corrected a logic error in the nUI_Button module that caused the cooldown counter to
	  not update if the '/nui bar durations' option was used to turn off spell duration
	  counters on the action bars
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Changed nUI's layout engine loader logic to key off of the ADDON_LOADED event 
	  rather than the VARIABLES_LOADED event to solve the loader reliability issue that
	  has been the key focus of the last several updates.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.15
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added traps to prevent passing nil numbers into CooldownFrame_StartTimer from nUI to
	  correct a nil number comparison error in the action bars
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_UnitAura module that would throw a nil table value 
	  error if auras are detected before the module is initialized (logging in while in
	  combat, etc.)
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.14
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed an error in the nUI_Splash module that was throwing a nil error if the 
	  player character's name is not available when the PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event fires
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.13
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated German localization (thank you Marcel)
	
	* Fixed an error in the nUI_UnitLabel module that threw an exception when in random
	  dungeons or battlefields and another player's name was not yet available
	  
	* Fixed an error in the nUI_ChatFrame module that throws a nil reference error for
	  some players when initializing the chat frame (thank you for running that down Xrystal)
	  
	* Fixed an error in nUI_MicroMenu that threw a nil anchor error for some users when
	  loging into the game
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Changed logic for unit health and power to ensure all units update at the maximum
	  rate including the new boss frames
	  
	* Fixed an error throwing a nil value exception in nUI_MicroMenu.lua at line 236
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.11
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a problem with key bindings not being restored to the default Blizzad action
	  bars on logout.
	  
	* I *think* this patch fixes the problem with the prompt for switching from character
	  specific key bindings to account wide key bindings.
	  
	* Added the dungeon completion alert frame to nUI's movers so it does not overlap the
	  action bars when displayed and to make it moveable.
	  
	* Added boss frames to nUI's unit panels -- currently located directly below the 
	  upper console -- not the best location, but the only one that works for now.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Resolved a loop in the key binding logic that caused repeating key binding notices
      while in combat
      
    * I'm confident we may actually have finally fixed the key bindings not being present
      at login issue with this release... changed how nUI's key bindings are initialized
      and early testing among some users with the problem have shown promise.
      
    * Located a taint problem with key bindings causing the action bars to break while in
      combat when changing stances, forms, stealth, etc. I do not know if this is the only
      bug related to that problem, so it may not be fixed for everyone. We'll see.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Modified key binding logic, yet again, in hopes of mitigating the problems further...
      however, key bindings do remain a problem /sigh
      
    * Reverse key bindings for the action bars to the left and right of the unit frames to
      match the bindings in the Blizzard interface. Not sure when VerticalMultiBar3 and
      VerticalMultiBar4 changed places, but nUI now matches them correclty.

    * Changed the initialization of the chat frame to account for a load issue in the
      Blizzard loader causing a "attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value" error in
      line 214 of nUI's nUI_ChatFrame.lua code.
         
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.08
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Taking a stab at fixing the key binding issues for Druids and Rogues -- I don't know
      if this is a fix or not. Hoping it is. Feedback is requested.
      
    * Added the Boss Target Frames to nUI's list of managed Blizzard frames
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.07
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed an experience bar error that throws an error if you hit level 79 with enough
	  rested XP to reach past level 80
	  
	* Moved the location of the dungeon difficulty flag into the location box so it does 
	  not overlap the tracking icon on the minimap
	  
	* Fixed the party role indicators on the unit frames
	
	* Modified the size and location of the quest watch frame to make room for the quest
	  number indicators on the left and eliminate wasted space on the right
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.06 (EBF)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* This update is an emergency bug fix to address an error introduced into nUI_UnitRole
	  by the addition of the new Blizzard tank/healer/damage role icons to the unit frames
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.05
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added new World Map Frame to the list of movable frames
	
	* Modified how unit health is updated to address an issue where player, pet and/or 
      target health bars are not always updated
      
	* Added the Looking for Raid and Looking for Dungeon frames to the nUI movable frames
	
	* Tweaked the location of the top console slightly -- moving it up to remove some of 
	  the dead space that's been bothering me forever by that I keep putting off doing
	  anything about ~grin~
	  
	* Fixed an issue that caused raid leader, tank and off-tank icons to not display
	  on unit frames
	  
	* Added new Blizzard tank, healer and damage role icons to unit frames
	
	* Removed the new Looking For Raid/Dungeon icon out of the button bag to the top
	  center of the minimap.
	  
	* Added integration of ChocolateBar in the same fashion ad Titan Panel and FuBar with 
	  thanks to Brillynt for having done the integration work
	  
	* Fixed the map coordinate display in the world map to account for the new map layout

	* Added detection of Prat 3.3 to the chat frame integration to fix an error being
	  thrown when Prat 3.3 is installed with nUI
	  
	* Added the party member background frame to the list of Blizzard frames nUI manages
	
	* Fixed a bug introduced by Blizzard in Patch 3.3 where the alpha level of models is
	  being reset to 1 when the user interface is hidden and reshown (a la open/close map
	  and zoning, etc.) This broke the '/nui anim' option's ability to disable animation
	  in the unit frames.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Released for WoW Patch 3.3
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.03 (PTR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Increased the frame strata level for the chat frame edit box to ensure that the edit
	  box is always over the chat frame text.
	  
	* Added detection of Prat-3.0 to the chat frame customization to allow Prat's management
	  of the chat frame edit box to override nUI's management.
	  
	* Changed how the chat frame edit box is scaled to improve readability for those who
	  enabled the "Use UI Scale" video option and use a scale other than 1.0
	  
	* Removed the '/nui watchframe' command -- no longer needed with the new watch frame
	
	* Added the new watch frame to the nUI movers
	
	* Added the new Looking for Dungeons button to the micro menu
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.02 (PTR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a new error introduced in nUI_Minimap.lua resulting from a Bliz change in the 
	  management of the minimap
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.01 (PTR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added a color code in the casting bar (bright red) to indicate spell casts that
	  cannot be interrupted
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.06.00 (PTR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* First cut at the new public test realm.
	
	* Fixed a load error in nUI.lua referencing TargetOfTargetFrame which appears to have
	  gone away or become optional
	  
	* Fixed a load error in nUI_Movers.lua with frames that do not current exist in the PTR
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.05.03 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a localization problem for the koKR localization which was causing a conflict
	  with the zhTW localization.
	  
	* Fixed an error in nUI_UnitCasting which would throw an exception if the target was
	  deselected between the time the casting change was flagged and the update
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.05.02 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed an integration issue between nUI and Titan Panel where the two mods were
	  fighting over management of the bag locations when openning bags. Note... since this
	  patch was made, Titan has also been updated to add an option to turn off Titan's
	  management of the bag locations via the right-click options settings in Titan.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the advanced objectives tracking management in nUI so that the
	  tracking window is now correctly sized and located when nUI is initially installed.
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui watchframe' which allows the user to manally reset
	  the size and location of the advanced objectives tracking frame should the location
	  be lost or otherwise problematic. By default nUI only sets the size and location of
	  the frame once when the player logs in on a character for the first time... after
	  that the player and relocate the frame as they see fit. This option allows them to
	  reset the location to the nUI default at any time after the initial login.
	  	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.05.01 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added a patch for integrating the default WoW 3.2 Blizzard Shaman totem bar into nUI
	
	* Fixed a problem with the battlefield minimap which prevented it from being included
	  in the information panel as it should be which was caused by a new bug Blizzard
	  introduced in the LoadAddOn() method for load on demand addons. /sigh
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui bar totems' to allow players with a Shaman to control
	  whether or not the default Blizzard totem bar is displayed. nUI uses the default 
	  Blizzard totem bar for Shamans. If you would prefer to use an alternate addon for 
	  totems, the '/nui bar totems' option can be used to cause nUI to hide the default 
	  totem bar.
	  
	* Fixed a few logic errors in nUI_Movers.lua which were causing some taint issues.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.05.00 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated the TOC for WoW patch 3.2
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.04.00 (Release)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* This is an release cut of nUI as of development version 5.03.13
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.13 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* This update fixes a problem with fonts for nUI users who are using the Russian 
	  localization file.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.12 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated Spanish localization file (thank you Jose)

	* Added new font options to improve readability. Still need to add a GUI panel for the
	  player to use to change fonts in-game. For now, see the appropriate localization file
	  in [ Interface > Addons > nUI > Main ]
	
	* Added a new feature to the action bars... when you have an active target, or you are
	  in combat, any button on your action bar which is unusable, is on cooldown or is 
	  active on the target is dimmed to indicate that is cannot be cast at present, or does
	  not need to be cast. Any spell which can be cast, is not in cooldown and is not active
	  on the target (or yourself) is displayed at full brightness. This acts as a quick
	  visual cue as to which actions you should/could be using at present.
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui bar dimming' to toggle the new action button dimming
	  feature on and off.
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui bar dimalpha {n}' which allows the player to set a 
	  custom alpha level for action buttons that are currently dimmed. The default is 30%
	  or '/nui bar dimalpha 0.30' -- valid values are 0 < {n} <= 1 where 0 is fully
	  transparent and 1 is fully opaque (the same as turning off the dimming feature). 
	  Note that you cannot use an opactity of 0 as that does have special meaning to the
	  action button logic.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in nUI_StatusBar which threw an error when the bar was oriented
	  to grow from the top down
	  
	* Added tick tracking to the health and power bars to visually indicate how much health
	  and/or power was gained or lost since the last bar update.
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui bar mouseover' which when active causes nUI's action
	  bars to be hidden unless and until you mouse over them.
	
	* Tweaked nUI_Button module to correct an issue showing the Pally judgment spells on
	  the action buttons correctly. 
	  	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.11 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a taint error caused by opening the world map while in combat
	
	* Replaced the nUI button bag button icon with the nUI logo
	
	* Fixed cooldown graphic on Death Knight runes
	
	* Moved cooldown timers on DK runes and modified rune transparency on cooldown to
	  improve visibility of the type of rune on cooldown
	  
	* Fixed a logic error on DK runes that displayed all of the cooldown timers on the 
	  first rune in the bar if timers are disabled.
	  
	* Fixed an error in the nUI_Button module which threw an exception in UnitIsUnit while
	  in a battleground
	  
	* Fixed an addon configuration error which caused the nUI load to log errors in the
	  FrameXML log "Unknown frame type: Binding"
	  
	* Fixed an addon configuration error which caused nUI's bindings to not function as
	  expected on systems that use case sensitive file names
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.10 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* We're on a roll tonight /sigh -- another EBF for the new trinket code
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.09 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* This is an EBF to fix a typo in the new trinket cooldown entries in the cooldown bar.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.08 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added cooldowns for usable equipped items to the cooldown bar (trinkets, etc.)
	
	* Enhanced action bar counters to use strong color cues to compress information. When
	  the player has a spell cast (HOT or DOT) on a target and that spell is still on
	  cooldown, the time remaining on the *spell* (not the cooldown) is displayed in
	  purple. Once the cooldown expires, or if there is no cooldown, the time remaining
	  on the *spell* is displayed in bright blue (cyan). If the spell is on cooldown but
	  is not currently active on the target, the cooldown time remaining is displayed in
	  yellow until the last ten seconds of the cooldown when it shows in red. A visual
	  explanation of the color scheme can be found at nUI's support forum...
	  
	  http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showpost.php?p=141448&postcount=16
	
	* Fixed a tooltip error in the nUI_PetFeeder module which caused all of the food items
	  in the feeder window to display the same tooltip.
	  
	* added a new slash command '/nui bar cooldown' -- This option is used to turn the 
	  display of cooldowns (displayed in yellow on the action bar) on and off. By default 
	  this feature is enabled.

	* added a new slash command '/nui bar duration' -- By default, when you cast a spell 
	  on a target, the time remaining on the spell is displayed in blue on the action bar. 
	  This option turns that timer feature off.

	* added a new slash command '/nui bar macro' -- When you place a custom macro on the 
	  action bar, nUI display's the macro's name on the button. This option will turn that 
	  display on and off.

	* added a new slash command '/nui bar stackcount' -- nUI normally displays the stack 
	  counts of inventory items that are on your action bars in the lower right corner of 
	  the button. This option can be used to turn that display on and off.

	* added a new slash command '/nui bar keybind' -- When you have a key bound to an 
	  action button, the key name is normally displayed in the top left corner of the 
	  button. This option can be used to turn that display on and off.

	* Fixed an error in nUI_Button.lua which threw an exception trying to compare a string
	  with a number on some characters at login.
	  
	* Removed the health and power text values from the simple HUD that were accidentally
	  left there in the 5.03.07 release.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.07 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Modified the tooltip change made in 5.03.06 as it was conflicting with most tooltip
	  addons and causing the tooltips to "jump" between locations -- this should be fixed
	  
	* Made some changes in the nUI_Button.lua module to try and fix a bug introduced in
	  5.03.06 which was causing "invalid spell slot" errors and causing UnitIsUnit() to
	  throw invalid unit ID errors.
	  
	* Fixed a bug in nUI_Button.lua where it would throw and exception of (for some who
	  knows what reason) an aura on the target didn't have an ID for who cast the aura
	  
	* Updated the Russian localization file (with thanks to StingerSoft)
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.06 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added HOT and DOT timers to the action bars. Cooldowns are now displayed in yellow
	  until the last 10 seconds of the cooldown, then the become red, as before. However,
	  regardless of whether or not there's a cooldown on the action, if the spell associated
	  with the action button is active on the current target, the time remaining before 
	  the spell expires is displayed in bright blue (cyan) counting down to zero.
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui hud cdmin {n}' which sets the minimum amount of time 
	  required for a spell to be displayed on the cooldown bar when it first begins the 
	  cooldown. If the initial cooldown period is less than {n}, it won't display. The 
	  default value is '/nui hud cdmin 2'
	  
	* Fixed an error in the pet feeder which would throw an exception if you had more than
	  one stack of the same food in your bags when you tried to open the feed pet window
	  
	* Fixed a German localization error where a "DEAD" player was reported as "TOD" (DEATH)
	  instead of "TOT" (DEAD)
	  
	* Removed the healthrace bar from the Player/Target and Health/Power HUD modes since it
	  is largely redundant in those applications.
	  
	* Added raid target icon to the "Simple HUD" mode -- located bottom center just above the
	  healthrace bar
	  
	* Added player and target debuffs to the "Simple HUD" mode -- located to the left and
	  right of the health race bar.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the new event engine in nUI_UnitPvP which causes the PvP flag
	  not to be removed from the unit frame once it has been displayed regardless of whether
	  or not the unit is still flagged for PvP
	  
	* Added enhanced unit information to the mouseover unit tooltip
	
	* Added unit's target to the tooltip for all unit frames
	
	* Added coloring of unit's health and power values in the unit frame tooltips according
	  to the same color using in their health bars for a quick visual indication of their
	  overall health/power
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the new event engine for nUI_UnitFeedback which was preventing
	  the hit/heal indicators and some other feedback features from functioning as designed
	  
	* Added a trap for an odd error in obtaining the current threat situation on a unit in
	  nUI_UnitFeedback that threw an error if you dropped target in the 1/30th of a second
	  (or less) between when the feedback update was initiated and when the threat check
	  was performed.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.05 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a logic error in nUI_UnitRaidSort which would cause the raid sort to fail and
	  never execute if the raid roster changed while in combat lockdown. This should also
	  address an unreported taint bug, as well.
	  
	* Added an option to sort raids by player name as well as group, class or unit id.
	
	* Added the voice chat frame to nUI's list of managed frames. The default location for
	  the frame has been set immediately above the vehicle seat indicator on the right edge
	  of the user display, slightly above center.
	  
	* Fixed combo point display for druis in cat form
	
	* Fixed combo point display for vehicles that use combo points in the actions
	
	* Fixed a tooltip error in nUI_UnitPvP that either showed an empty tooltip or threw
	  and error when the cursor moved over the PvP icon in the unit frame.
	
	* Fixed an error with the advanced objectives watch frame which broke the frame when
	  nUI management of the minimap is enabled. 
	  
	* Moved the default location of the advanced objectives watch frame to the upper left
	  of the user interface. nUI will only locate the watch frame the first time the user
	  logs in on each character... the frame can then be permanently moved using the built
	  in lock/unlock and mouseover features of the frame. Note: If game settings are not
	  being maintained on each character individually, you may need to log in on all of
	  your characters before attempting to set a permanent location for the frame other 
	  than the nUI default.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the '/nui calendar' slash command that caused it to fail to
	  work as expected the first time the player uses the command.
	  
	* Moved the calendar to the bottom of the minimap and modified its size slightly to
	  avoid conflict with the action bars and to improve the calendar's visibility when
	  the '/nui calendar' option is used to disable nUI management of the calendar.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error introduced in 5.03.03 in nUI_UnitReadyCheck that caused it to fail 
	  to clear the icons in the unit frames when the ready check was complete
	  
	* Fixed a logic error introduced in 5.03.03 in nUI_UnitRange which caused the range 
	  indicator to not correctly update once the initial range had been calculated

	* Fixed a logic error in the casting bars which caused the bars to not be displayed in
	  even though a cast was active in situations where the player is being spammed with
	  interrupts or pushbacks.
	  
	* Entirely removed generation of dynamic memory from the following modules as well
	  as changed how the callback notification system is engaged in order to reduce load
	  on the event engine and update thread: nUI_UnitCasting
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.04 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a bug introduced in the Death Knight's runes by the changes made in the 5.03.03
	  development update's rewrite of the event engine.
	  
	* Fixed a bug introduced in the unit frame tooltips where the party/raid role was
	  repeated until it filled the screen -- also introduced in the 5.03.03 rewrite of the
	  event engine.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.03 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added unit health and power to the unit tooltips
	
	* Added Poisoner to the list of minimap buttons nUI does not try to manage... this will
	  allow Poisoner users to locate this button anywhere they need it and stil have access
	  to it in combat without openning the button bag.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the button bag code which would cause buttons to become 
	  unclickable in certain circumstances.
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui calendar' -- By default, nUI moves the guild calendar 
	  button from the minimap into the button bag. This option toggles that on and off 
	  allowing for leaving the guild calendar displayed on the minimap.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in nUI_BagBar that caused it to ignore the mouseover visibility
	  option when the UI is initially loaded.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the XP bar that would throw an error if the player hit level
	  79 with more than a full rested level remaining.

	* Tweaked the nUI_SysInfo module to display the top ten memory users in the tooltip 
	  rather than the top three.
	  
	* Entirely removed generation of dynamic memory from the following modules as well
	  as changed how the callback notification system is engaged in order to reduce load
	  on the event engine and update thread: nUI, nUI_Location, nUI_PetFeeder, nUI_SysInfo,
	  nUI_Button, nUI_CooldownBar, nUI_UnitComboPoints, nUI_UnitFeedback, nUI_UnitFrame,
	  nUI_UnitGCD, nUI_UnitHappiness, nUI_UnitHealth, nUI_UnitLabel, nUI_UnitLevel,
	  nUI_UnitPortrait, nUI_UnitPower, nUI_StatusBar, nUI_UnitPvP, nUI_UnitRaidGroup,
	  nUI_UnitRaidTarget, nUI_UnitRange, nUI_UnitReaction, nUI_UnitReadyCheck, 
	  nUI_UnitResting, nUI_UnitRole, nUI_UnitRunes, nUI_UnitStatus

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.02 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_UnitChange module which causes it to fail to notify
	  event listeners when the party or raid roster was updated in certain circumstances
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI unit change update engine which caused the performance
	  of the engine to degrade over time as more unit data sets were cached by the engine.
	  
	* Modified the unit event dispatch engine and update notification system to eliminate
	  all production of garbage memory in that system. The underlying engine now retains
	  and reuses all memory it consumes. (note: this process is incremental, this reduces
	  the garbage memory created by nUI's data engine, but does not fix it entirely as 
	  yet given this process will need to be repeated in all of the modules in nUI before
	  the issue is entirely resolved) 
	  
	* Entirely removed generation of dynamic memory from the following modules as well
	  as changed how the callback notification system is engaged in order to reduce load
	  on the event engine and update thread: nUI_Unit, nUI_UnitChange, nUI_UnitClass,
	  nUI_UnitCombat
	  
	* Added information panel integration support for Skada
	
	* Added '/nui hud vofs {n}' slash command. This option sets vertical offset of the HUD 
	  from the center of the view port. The default is '/nui hud vofs 0' which places the 
	  HUD at the vertical center of the viewport. Values less than 0 move the HUD down, 
	  greater than 0 moves the HUD up.
	  
	* Added the timer bar to the list of movable bars... this is the bar used to show time
	  remaining for breath hold and exhaustion while swimming, etc.
	  
	* Implemented a fix for a conflict with TitanPanel when a bottom bar is enabled -- many
	  thanks to Tristanian for researching the issue and coming up with a solution.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_BagBar that prevented the bar from being movable via
	  '/nui movers' for many users
	  
	* Added the nUI special bar (pet/stance/shapeshift/auras) to the list of movable frames
	
	* Fixed a logic error in the nUI_StatusBar module which was causing issues with custom
	  textures and displaying full bars when they should not be
	  
	* Added the ability to right-click the unit panel selector, the information panel 
	  selector and the HUD mode selector buttons to move backwards through their respective
	  display modes. For example, left clicking the "Player" unit panel button will switch
	  to the "Party" unit panel mode. With this change, right-clicking the "Party" unit
	  panel button will switch back to the "Player" unit panel mode rather than having to
	  cycle through all of the raid panels to get back to the player mode.
	  
	* Made another change to nUI_Movers.lua to address ongoing conflicts with the new Bliz
	  advanced objectives tracking frame. nUI now has *zero* interaction with this frame
	  
	* Changed the vertical position of the player's aura buff bars so they do not conflict
	  with the settings tab in the chat frame
	  
	* Changed the anchoring the durability frame to the right edge of the display as a
	  result of changes made in patch 3.1 and the advanced objectives tracking
	  
	* Moved the anchor location of the vehicle seat indicator from the top center of the
	  display to the right edge of the display above the durability frame
	  
	* Modified nUI_UnitCasting to count down time remaining when channeling spells
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed the version number in the TOC
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.03.00
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added a new slash command '/nui mountscale {n}' which allows for setting a scale on
	  the special mount / vehicle seat indicator. This option sets the scale for the seat 
	  indicator displayed at the top center of the display when you are on a special mount. 
	  The default is '/nui mountscale 1' where 0.5 < {n} < 1.5 -- values less than 1.0 
	  cause the indicator to be smaller, values of {n} > 1.0 increase its size.
	  
	* Removed advanced objectives quest watch frame from list of managed Bliz frames... the
	  frame is already movable and sizable, no need to manage it.
	  
	* Added an event handler to trap when the player changes spec's if dual spec'd -- does
	  not yet work for party/raid members... only the player itself.
	  
	* Fixed a bug in the unit frame tooltips for raid unit frames that caused the mouseover
	  to display information for the wrong player after the raid frames were sorted
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.06 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Added a vehicle leave button to the pet/special bars for use with special mounts
	
	* Added the vehicle seat indicator to nUI's list of managed frames and movers
	
	* Modified nUI_UnitCasting to key on the UNIT_SPELLCAST_STOP event as the event that
	  clears an active casting bar to overcome a change in casting event logic introduced
	  in a prior Bliz patch that caused spamming the action bar to cancel the active cast
	  bar even though the spell was still active.
	  
	* Modified the cooldown bar audio alert logic to only allow audio alerts to play once
	  every two seconds and to never stack multiple audio alerts at one time (volume stack)
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in nUI_UnitAura which allowed the HOT/DOT bar to overflow its
	  defined maximum size if that was less than the value set by '/nui maxauras {n}'
	  
	* Modified the combat log to not alter the font size when the player session starts
	  so that player preferences are not overwritten by the nUI scale calculations
	  
	* Modified the cooldown bar to be aware of player talent spec swapping and to reset
	  the bar when the player changes spec.
	  
	* Fixed a bug in the '/nui autogroup' logic which caused it to not default to enabled
	
	* Added sorting of raid unit frames
	
	* Added new slash command '/nui raidsort {unit|group|class}' to select the type of sort
	  used on raid unit frames. The 'unit' option causes the raid unit frames to be sorted
	  by their unit ID from raid1 to raid40. The 'group' option causes the raid unit frames
	  to sort first by the raid group number then by player name within that group. The
	  'class' option causes the frames to sort first by player class, then by player name
	  within the class
	  
	* Added a trap for an error in nUI_UnitAura where it would throw an error if the system
	  detected an enchant on your weapon before the details of the enchant are available
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.05 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a logic error in the action bars which caused the buttons to be marked as
	  unavailable when they were not and visa versa.
	  
	* Updated Simplified Chinese localization files (thank you Yanwin) 
	
	* Updated Traditional Chinese localization files (thank you Yanwin) 
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.04 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a major bug introduced in 5.02.02 which prevented the action buttons from 
	  updating when you switched druid forms, warrior stances, rogue stealth, mounted or
	  dismounted a vehicle while in combat
	  
	* Fixed a bug in the new action bar code which prevented the ctrl-alt-right-click key
	  binding menu from working
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.03 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Facepalm -- I forgot to remove the comment from the vehicle menu bar after testing
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.02 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a layering bug in the combat log which caused the combat log filter buttons to
	  be under the combat log text
	  
	* Added vehicle seats to the main action bar when mounted
	
	* Added vehicle exit button to the main action bar when mounted
	
	* Added a check in the range indicator engine to ensure that all spells used in the
	  calculation have a max range that is greater than zero in an attempt to fix a range
	  bug introduced in 3.1 where spells are flagged as having range, but do not actually.
	  
	* Fixed a logic error in the range calculation
	
	* Recoded the nUI action bars to try and resolve a taint issue.
	
	* Modified the bar display logic so that possession or mounting a vehicle will override
	  action bar pages 2 though 5 so no matter which bar is the active page, it will now
	  display the spells for the possessed mob or vehicle. Note that shift-2 through 
	  shift-5 and the action bar scroll buttons no longer work when you are in possession 
	  of another mob/player or mounted on a vehicle.
	  
	* Added awareness of the presence of Chatter and disabled nUI's management of the chat
	  frame edit box if Chatter is present
	  
	* Added Russian localization (thank you Vlad)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.01 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Attempted fix for filtering between player spells and non-player spells
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.02.00 (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* First development release for WoW patch 3.1 on the live realms
	
	* Updated for PTR patch 0.1.0.9767
	
	* Fixed a bug in nUI_UnitLevel thrown when levelling a character using either the
	  Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese localization file
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.01.05 (PTR Beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated for PTR patch 0.1.0.9757
	
	* Added support for displaying agro feedback on more than one unit for off-tanks and 
	  agro grabs, threat wipes, etc.
	  
	* Added nUI_UnitThreat module to track threat on all active and available mobs for all
	  relevant unit IDs -- not yet added to the HUD however
	  
	* Fixed a bug in the '/nui feedback' slash command that threw an error if no argument 
	  was given
	  
	* Fixed a scaling bug in the bag bar available slots/stock count text
	
	* Added unit frame tooltips to the same control group as action bar tooltips so the
	  '/nui combattips' option turns their display on and off depending on whether you
	  are in combat or out of combat. Prevents tooltips from interfering with clicking
	  during combat. '/nui combattips' toggles this behavior on and off.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.01.04 (PTR Beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated for PTR patch 0.1.0.9742
	
	* completed compliance with Blizzard's new add-on development guidelines
	
	* Introduced nUI+
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.01.03 (PTR Beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Ported nUI to PTR patch 0.1.0.9704 compatibility
	
	* Fixed a bug in the Battlefield Minimap integration resulting from the new patch
	
	* Changed HUD casting bars to show casting time rather than percent by default
	
	* Change player, target and focus unit frame casting bars to show time rather than percent
	
	* Changed casting bar time display to show tenths of a second
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.01.02 (PTR Beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Updated TOC for WoW patch 3.1
	
	* Changed talent spec module to ignore requests for build info on the mouseover unit
	  which apparently causes conflicts with the tooltip engine when the player is trying
	  to inspect their own gear
	
	* Added a block gap between the stance bar and pet bar when both are displayed together
	
	* Updated nUI_UnitAura to reflect changes in the UnitAura() API return values in 3.1
	
	* Updated French localization file (thank you Arnaud)
	
	* Updated Spanish localization file (thank you José)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.01.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Removed an old debug print line the produced the odd message "using cooldown for this"
	  in the chat frame at seemingly random times
	  
	* Updated German localization file (thank you Marcel)
	
	* Adjusted the size of the cooldown bar in an attempt to stop it from wrapping
	
	* Added casting bars to the player and target unit frames in the 25 and 40 man raids
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.01.00
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* nUI sheds its "beta" status and goes live... /happydance
	
	* Split nUI into two versions... the public "nUI Lite" free version and the private
	  "nUI Pro" version for nUI's supporters
	  
	* Added linkbacks to nUI's new web site at http://www.nUIAddOn.com
	
	* Fixed a logic error in the '/nui feedback' slash command that threw an error if a
	  bad argument, or no argument, was given to the command.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.00.03 (Alpha)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Yet another fix for the agro logic to prevent complex hard loops (player targets a
	  mob to targets a player to targets a mob who targets the original player for example)
	  which continued to cause WoW lockups.
	  
	* Added a new set of slash commands for the feedback system...
	
	  /nui feedback curse
	  /nui feedback disease
	  /nui feedback magic
	  /nui feedback poison
	  
	  These options allow the player to individually disable or enable each of the four
	  feedback highlight types so that you can enable only those types you can dispell. By
	  default all four types are enabled.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.00.02 (Alpha)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a logic error in the determination of who has current agro that caused WoW to
	  freeze if any unit in the target chain was targeting itself (yes, an endless loop)
	  
	* Added a new slash command '/nui showhits' which turns off the red/green background
	  highlighting on unit frames when they are taking damage or receiving heals.
	  
	* Fixed the rotation order in the unit frames to 25 man precedes 40 man
	
	* Fixed a logic error in the aura bars where the bars failed to resize when the target
	  died or when switching to a new target that had no auras on it
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.00.01 (Alpha)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Ported nUI 5.0 to WoW Patch 3.1
	
	* Added combat feedback to unit frames... shows a red background on unit frames when 
	  the unit takes damage, a green background when it receives a heal
	  
	* Added debuff highlights to unit frames... unit frame borders highlight blue when a
	  magic debuff is on the unit, green when diseased, yellow when poisoned and purple
	  when cursed.
	  
	* Add agro indicator to unit frames... unit frame border highlights in red when the
	  unit is targeted by a hostile unit in the player's target chain or focus chain if
	  no hostile units exist in the target chain.
	  
	* Greatly improved the hit and heal indicator update frequency in the battlefield
	  minimap for PvP/Battleground play
	  
	* Finally found and added a fix for the annoying invisible bottom bar Titan Panel
	  creates. This should prevent that bar from interfering with the bottom of the dashboard
	  
	* Added the slash command '/nui hud focus' which toggles display of the player's focus
	  on and off in the HUD. By default, the HUD ignores the focus frame and displays the
	  player's target and target-of-target (ToT). Enabling this option will cause the HUD
	  to replace the player's target with the player's focus if and when the player sets a
	  focus. In addition, when this option is enabled, the ToT is replaced with the focus' 
	  target if a focus is set. If no focus is set, the HUD will display the target and 
	  the ToT as per normal.
	  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.00.00 (Alpha)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * First release
